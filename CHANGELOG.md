# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.1] - 2026-04-04

### Fixed

- Detect missing `resolvconf` before WireGuard connect on Linux ([#186](https://github.com/Harry-kp/vortix/issues/186), [#187](https://github.com/Harry-kp/vortix/pull/187)) — Vortix now shows clear install instructions instead of cryptic wg-quick errors when DNS is configured but resolvconf isn't available on Arch/Fedora
- Add CLI dependency check to catch missing tools before connection attempts



## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-31

### Added

- Add a CLI-first headless mode with structured JSON output for scripting, automation, and AI-agent workflows, including `vortix status` for scriptable connection and kill-switch visibility ([#156](https://github.com/Harry-kp/vortix/issues/156), [#176](https://github.com/Harry-kp/vortix/pull/176)).
- Add the new flip-panel dashboard interaction with animated card transitions ([#165](https://github.com/Harry-kp/vortix/pull/165)).

### Changed

- VPN sessions can now keep running after the TUI or CLI exits, so leaving the interface no longer tears down an active connection unexpectedly ([#155](https://github.com/Harry-kp/vortix/issues/155), [#176](https://github.com/Harry-kp/vortix/pull/176)).
- Make `vortix down` wait for the OpenVPN daemon to fully exit before reporting success ([#176](https://github.com/Harry-kp/vortix/pull/176)).

### Fixed

- Remove the stale quit confirmation now that active connections can continue independently of the UI process ([#179](https://github.com/Harry-kp/vortix/issues/179), [#182](https://github.com/Harry-kp/vortix/pull/182)).
- Fix help overlay scrolling edge cases, including opening before the first resize and clamping scroll correctly after keyboard and mouse input ([#180](https://github.com/Harry-kp/vortix/issues/180), [#182](https://github.com/Harry-kp/vortix/pull/182)).
- Harden CLI lifecycle handling around disconnect flow, error paths, and config isolation ([#176](https://github.com/Harry-kp/vortix/pull/176)).

### Documentation

- Clarify current Linux support expectations and improve Linux bug-reporting guidance for distro-specific issues ([#185](https://github.com/Harry-kp/vortix/pull/185)).

### CI

- Add Fedora 41 CI coverage for `cargo check`, `cargo clippy`, `cargo test`, and `cargo doc`, including unprivileged test execution for Linux-specific validation ([#160](https://github.com/Harry-kp/vortix/issues/160), [#183](https://github.com/Harry-kp/vortix/pull/183)).



## [0.1.8] - 2026-03-19

### Features

- Add centralized theming system — all colors now flow through `theme.rs`, replacing hardcoded `Color::Rgb` across 13 UI files ([#109](https://github.com/Harry-kp/vortix/issues/109), [#147](https://github.com/Harry-kp/vortix/issues/147))
- Add mouse click-to-select for profiles in the sidebar ([#139](https://github.com/Harry-kp/vortix/issues/139))
- Add Wayland clipboard support via `wl-copy`, with `xclip`/`xsel` fallback on X11 ([#107](https://github.com/Harry-kp/vortix/issues/107))
- Add word-wrapped log messages with accurate scroll using `Paragraph::line_count()` — long OpenVPN errors no longer truncate

### Bug Fixes

- Fix OpenVPN error messages not shown in UI — vortix now reads the daemon log file when stderr is empty due to `--daemon --log` ([#154](https://github.com/Harry-kp/vortix/issues/154))
- Fix footer truncating Help and Quit hints first on narrow terminals — critical hints now have priority, with unicode-aware width calculation ([#134](https://github.com/Harry-kp/vortix/issues/134))
- Fix cursor style inconsistent across overlays — all text fields now use the same blinking block cursor ([#135](https://github.com/Harry-kp/vortix/issues/135))
- Fix URL import leaving temp files behind in system temp directory ([#136](https://github.com/Harry-kp/vortix/issues/136))
- Fix race condition where temp file could be deleted before import completes on TUI URL import
- Fix clipboard copy reporting success without checking the tool's exit status
- Fix toast messages logged at wrong severity level (e.g., connection failures logged as INFO instead of ERROR)

### Refactor

- Generalize `centered_rect` helper to support both percentage-based and fixed-size centering, removing duplicate code ([#123](https://github.com/Harry-kp/vortix/issues/123))
- Eliminate per-frame `String` allocations in footer hint rendering

### Testing

- Add unit tests for rename-profile path traversal validation with rejection assertions ([#137](https://github.com/Harry-kp/vortix/issues/137))
- Add unit tests for `cleanup_temp_download`, footer hint width calculations, `centered_rect` variants, and theme alias consistency

### Miscellaneous

- **deps:** Bump the rust-minor group with 2 updates ([#152](https://github.com/Harry-kp/vortix/pull/152))



## [0.1.7] - 2026-03-11

### Bug Fixes

- Fix Escape/CloseOverlay resetting zoomed panel back to normal layout ([#105](https://github.com/Harry-kp/vortix/issues/105))
- Fix sidebar "Reconnect" action disconnecting instead of reconnecting the selected profile ([#106](https://github.com/Harry-kp/vortix/issues/106), [#145](https://github.com/Harry-kp/vortix/issues/145))
- Fix exponential backoff overflow causing infinite retry delays at high attempt counts ([#110](https://github.com/Harry-kp/vortix/issues/110))
- Fix renaming a profile breaking reconnect by not updating `last_connected_profile` ([#111](https://github.com/Harry-kp/vortix/issues/111))
- Fix deleting a profile during Connecting or Disconnecting state causing state corruption ([#112](https://github.com/Harry-kp/vortix/issues/112))
- Fix "IP unchanged" warning flooding logs every telemetry poll cycle while connected ([#113](https://github.com/Harry-kp/vortix/issues/113))
- Fix 0ms latency falsely showing EXCELLENT quality instead of UNKNOWN ([#146](https://github.com/Harry-kp/vortix/issues/146))

### Features

- Add `ConnectSelected` action: sidebar `r` key now connects the highlighted profile rather than the last-used one
- Add `Unknown` quality state when no metrics have arrived yet, displayed as "─────" in header and "UNKNOWN" in details
- Include latency in connection quality scoring (Poor ≥ 300ms, Fair ≥ 100ms)
- Cap retry backoff at configurable `connect_retry_max_delay_secs` (default 300s)

### Documentation

- Rewrite ROADMAP as a product journey with themed releases and user stories

### Miscellaneous

- Fix Unicode text input causing panic in text field handlers ([#98](https://github.com/Harry-kp/vortix/issues/98))
- Add `Drop` impl on `App` to clean up kill switch rules and VPN processes on panic ([#99](https://github.com/Harry-kp/vortix/issues/99))
